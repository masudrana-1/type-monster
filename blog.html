            <h2>What is the difference between localStorage and session storage?</h2>
            <p>The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
                sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a
                document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.</p>
